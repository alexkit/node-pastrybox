One day last week we had a freak hail storm and lost all power to thehouse. I had been desperately trying to
work on an article that justwasn't happening. Frustrated, stuck inside with no WiFi and a veryenergetic cat
who kept wanting out to play with the hailstones, Ipicked up one of her kitty toys and started to distract
her.

Within a few moments we were engaged in a kitty vs. human romp all overthe house, each of us chasing after her
toy. By the time we stopped,with at least one of us exhausted (you can imagine who), theelectricity had been
on for a half hour, the WiFi back on. When I wentback to work, I was able to refocus the article into
something thatmade sense.

Why we lose or deny us the power of play, whether it be with ourchildren or pets and especially each other, is
a disturbing question.I encourage everyone to ask if they play enough. And if you find youdon't, I encourage
you join me in learning that play is as equally ifnot more important to the creative process than the
hyperfocus we tendto give our work.

Let's play!
