Here in the UK, summer has been cancelled and we’re awaiting thehoards for the Olympics in a couple of
weeks. It struck me that it’sthe perfect time to take a break—and I mean a real one—and escapethe
slightly disappointing condition of the climate here. Which isexactly what I did, and just got back from my
first trip to a foreignland in a long while that didn’t involve also intending a conference.And it was
great—I feel refreshed, focussed and significantly moreenthused about the work I was doing before I
left.

I think those of us who are enthusiastic about our jobs, and considerourselves “lifestyle nerds”
rarely stop and do something unrelated toour work, often spending free time reading on-topic, at conferences,
orworking on side projects. We tend to consider just “not being in theoffice” as enough, and
consider that alone to be the same as taking abreak.

So, other than gloating about being away, my recommendation is to gooutside and forget about the internet.
It’ll still be here when youget back.
