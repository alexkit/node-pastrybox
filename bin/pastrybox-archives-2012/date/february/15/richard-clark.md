As designers & developers I'd say that we're pretty much always soldon concepts such as progressive
enhancement, responsive web design,designing in the browser, etc. We want to actively incorporate
theseprocesses into our work as much as we can. Problems can arise though,for those of us who work in
agencies. Want to build that next siteresponsively? Someone has to pay.

In my role, I'm lucky that I get to meet clients early on and explainthese concepts to them and explain the
benefits. Others I know thatwork in larger agencies or big organizations aren't so lucky. They'rehampered by
archaic processes or sales people who refuse to altertheir stock script. If this sounds like you, become an
educator, sitdown and show them these new techniques and highlight the benefits.Generally people are
responsive to new ideas and ultimately you're theexpert. If they choose not to listen, do yourself a favor and
go findsome smart people to work for.
