Writing on the trip home from [TXJS](http://2012.texasjavascript.com)today, I realise I just gave my first
talk in over 18 months and thatfor the first time I wasn’t scared. I wonder what’s changed?
I’dbeen putting off doing any more speaking mostly through a lack ofconfidence and a few sub-par panels
at SxSW I’d participated in.

Recent conversations with friend, and fellow baker, Rachel Andrewinspired me with her tales of being afraid of
speaking, and flying,and just telling herself to not be anymore. Her blog post [PublicSpeaking for the
(Formerly)
Terrified](http://www.rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/2012/05/02/public-speaking-for-the-formerly-terrified/) is a
sure read for anyone who has been put off speaking in the past.

The experience this last week was a blast, and I suppose I just wantto encourage anyone who has thought of
speaking, or tried it and foundit uncomfortable, that maybe you should give it another go. I mightnot have
been brilliant, but it turns out that it can actually beenjoyable to share a story about something you care
about, which isultimately the point of getting up on stage in the first place.
