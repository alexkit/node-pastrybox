Today, I’m taking my nephew to the zoo. We’re going to feed thesoulful, friendly giraffes and
there are some young lion pups too. Myfavorite creatures are the anteaters and the huge tortoises.
Thenwe’ll go sit in the aviary and listen to the shrieks of the beautiful,diverse birds in all their
colorful glory. 

What does this have to do with doing great design work? Getting offthe computer and into the
world—interacting with the happiness of achild among animals, sounds, smells and rich environments are all
partof refreshing ourselves as well as inspiring us through the sensoryjoy of simply being.

So do yourself a favor this week. Get offline and go do somethingthat’s colorful, smelly, silly and
joyous!
