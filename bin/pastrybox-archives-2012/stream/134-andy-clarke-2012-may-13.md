About a year ago, I left day rates and job rates behind and started estimating, billing and working on
projects on a weekly basis. A year on and I’m better organised, more productive and less stressed than ever
before. Our accounts are in better shape and no one owes us money for longer than a week. It was one of the
best business moves I’ve made.
