Open source software requires effort.

Many times, I’ve encountered individuals with fantastic ideas.However, when pressed for code or more
detail, I’ll get the answer, “Idon’t have time right now.” And yet, the expectation is
that somebodywill take that idea and run with it.

A few times, I’ve taken up such challenges—and in almost all casesI’ve regretted it, because
once implemented, the person with theoriginal idea will come back and say it doesn’t match
theirexpectations. In the world of open source, such criticism is oftenvery public, and generally damaging to
the projects and people behindthem.

So now, my mantra is: an idea does not have merit unless there iseffort behind it: effort to provide a
detailed explanation of how youenvision it, effort to provide a prototype detailing the idea, effortto test
the work others have done to implement your idea. Anybody canspit out ideas, but it takes effort to make those
ideas a reality, andthat effort should be valuable enough to warrant effort on your partas well.
