To move through the world, to drink with people of the streets, ordine with kings who will never know such
poverty: Our life's giftscome with both kisses and wounds. To seek shelter from experience isto live life
quietly, and while completely understandable, peopleworking the Web - advocating for better practices and
embracing theideals at the Web's core - must consider living life loudly.

If you seek comfort in your work, then claim that comfort - for youdeserve it. But if you seek revolution and
evolution? Desire to becomemore involved in evangelizing or advocating a given position? Ask apauper, or ask a
Queen, and you will come to understand what it meansto be both a pauper and infinitely wealthy in the same
moment. Youwill also learn that the greatest equalizer of all is found in ourmoments of shared truth, no
matter where we sit in the grand stadiumof life.

To me, that is the greatness of the Web - that we can become equals -that we are made equals in our
limitations and our vision. And throughour conversations - the open discourse that drives an Open Web, wewill
certainly extend beyond our limitations and visions to new levelsof insight and inspiration.

Move through the world, and work to not be afraid to face the facts ofpoverty or to be enthralled by royalty.
We are equals in those kissesand wounds, and uplifted by shared resources and truth.
