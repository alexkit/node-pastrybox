In 1995, back when the Web design and development industry was only atoddler, we began to be able to work with
color. Of course, manyreaders will remember the need for "web safe" color when a typicalvideo card and monitor
could only calculate 256 colors. With 50 ofthose reserved for system use, we ended up with a 216 color
palettethat was considered most consistent across all browsers. I had comefrom the world of dumb terminals, so
I was used to green or amber texton black and it never occurred to me that having to limit a colorpalette for
this new and exciting communication space might feellimiting to some. 

Over the next year, I was brutally disavowed of thisby my students, who regularly would grouse about the lack
of "real"color on the Web. Almost as new to the Web as my students, I wasstruggling for a way to explain this
to them that showed that 216colors was actually a luxury for many people in 1995 - up to andincluding working
Web designers, who often had to limit the paletteeven more if they were serving users without 256 or more
colorsupport. Then one day, I stopped by my office to pick something up,and one of the daytime professors whom
I'd not met was there. Shejumped up and gave me a hug, expressing great personal warmth and anartist's
excitement about the Web. "Molly," she said. "I feel so freeon the Web. I've been working in print design my
entire career and Ifinally get to work with more than four colors!"

Suffice it to say, I had found a positive answer for my students! Atthe time, her response was very unique.
Nowadays, we never really needto think about color limitations anymore, except insofar as those whotake extra
care in designing for forms of color blindness. Otherwise,on-screen color palettes in the millions exist in
today's Web designand development. It is a solved problem, and if that problem can besolved, so can the many
others which we face. Go forth today and colorthe world, and embrace our progress as creatives, technologists
and anindustry.
