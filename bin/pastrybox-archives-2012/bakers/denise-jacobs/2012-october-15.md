Seriously??! Yes, seriously! Today, in just a few hours, I will be having brunch with the woman I met, the guy

shimmering right underneath the surface of our everyday existence, waiting for us to take notice. Clearly,
serendipity is a part of that force, and I’m not complaining. In fact, I’m in hopeful expectation of the
next “happy accident” and my new awesome job, whatever it may be.
