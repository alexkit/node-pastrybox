Time. It's a precious commodity. Some would argue that time is,perhaps, the most precious commodity. Family,
friends, work, hobbies,chores, side projects, education & more all warrant & need our timeyet it's the one
thing we can't have more of. Sure we can work smarterand use tools to improve our productivity but ultimately
we can't havemore time. I often find myself thinking about dormant domains, lookingthrough sketchbooks and
notepads full of great ideas. 

How many greatideas for side (or other) projects never come to fruition because of alack of time? We need a
place to share those ideas with like mindedpeople. Blogs, Twitter, Github, Kickstarter & others help
facilitatethis but all are lacking in some way. I'd like to see a place where Ican give ideas away, some
throwaway, some more thought through. Aplace where someone will take on those ideas if they deem them
worthyand because they have the time. Maybe somewhere exists that I don'tknow about, or maybe this is just
another idea I don't have time for.
