If you’re feeling like you’re having a down day at work — everythingseems mundane, ordinary,
unexciting, or you don’t know why you’rethere — explain what you do to someone. Tell them about
what you’rebuilding, why it matters and what makes it a challenge. Why did youjoin up and what are the
big-picture outcomes?

If explaining what you do doesn’t instantly lift your mood and makeyou excited about creating things,
maybe it *is* time to dustoff the CV.
