Google’s home page from 1998. While visually quite different, again,essentially the same user experience
as Google today. And it doesn’tstop there. Think about search engine results. In essence, a list
ofaround a dozen potential matches, with a short description and a linkfor users to follow. This really
hasn’t changed at all since the verybeginning of the web. (Results have become more relevant, but when
wasthe last time you went beyond the first page of results? Beyond thefirst two or three results? Surely with
billions of documents, for anysearch there’s likely to be more than a handful of relevant results?)

So what’s the point?

To some extent we live in an ever-present now, of exciting cool newstuff. To put it harshly, we live in George
Santayana’s perpetualinfancy. We should step back once in a while, from the sense ofexcitement mixed
with panic, that we are missing out, that it will allpass us by, and get a sense of perspective, of where we
have comefrom, and maybe even think a little about where we are going.
