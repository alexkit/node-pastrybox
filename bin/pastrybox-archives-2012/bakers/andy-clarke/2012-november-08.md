The imaginatively titled Mr. Benn followed the adventures of, err, Mr. Benn, a bowler hat wearing businessman
(whose occupation still remains a mystery) who over just thirteen short episodes from 1971 had amazing
adventures.

From Wikipedia:

> Mr Benn, a man wearing a black suit and bowler hat, leaves his house
> at 52 Festive Road and visits a fancy-dress costume shop where he is invited by the moustachioed, fez-wearing
> shopkeeper to try on a particular outfit. He leaves the shop through a magic door at the back of the changing
> room and enters a world appropriate to his costume, where he has an adventure (which usually contains a moral)
> before the shopkeeper reappears to lead him back to the changing room, and the story comes to an
> end.

Don’t bother trying Google Maps, Festive Road ain’t in London.

With a fond smile I can remember watching Mr. Benn. The work of his writer and illustrator David McKee was
sublime in its charm and naivity and the minimal animation rarely consisted of more than a panning camera
across McKee’s wonderful drawings. His adventures all centered around helping the people he met after
walking through the other door.

But even today there are some unanswered questions: Where did Mr. Benn keep all the stuff he nicked souvenirs
from his adventures? Why didn’t he tell the shopkeeper to @%&@*% off! every time he interrupted an
adventure? I suppose we’ll never know, but Mr. Benn remains one of my classic cartoon memories.
