I have a guilty secret. 

When I was a kid, I really enjoyed watching [Little House on the
Prairie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_House_on_the_Prairie_(TV_series)).

(The simple life in Walnut Grove, skipping home along the lane from school.)

I would never have admitted that at the time, for fear of the kids in school calling me a poof. But, on a
Sunday morning I watched Little House on the Prairie week after week after week.

Then something terrible happened.

We went away on a family holiday and when we got back, Mary Ingalls (the pretty, older daughter) had gone
blind! 

Years went by and while I was at art school, Channel 4 repeated Little House on the Prairie on Sunday
mornings. Now in my own rented flat I needn’t worry about being ridiculed, so I watched it again from the
beginning, week after week after week.

Then something terrible happened.

I went home for a weekend for a family birthday and when I got back, Mary Ingalls (the pretty, older daughter)
had gone blind!

Again!

To this day, despite Wikipedia, despite YouTube, I’ve never discovered how this calamity happened. 

I think it was my fault.
