Not everyone who works with technology loves technology. No, really,it’s true! Most of the people out
there building stuff with web techdon’t attend conferences, don’t talk about WebGL in the pub,
don’twrite a blog with CSS3 “experiments” in it, don’t like what they do.It’s a
job: come in at 9, go home at 5, don’t think about HTML outsidethose hours. Apparently 90% of the stuff
in the universe is “darkmatter”: undetectable, doesn’t interact with other matter,
can’t beseen even with a really big telescope. Our “dark matter developers”,who aren’t
part of the community, who barely even know that thecommunity exists… how are we to help them? You can
write all the AList Apart articles you like but dark matter developers don’t read it.And so
everyone’s intranet is horrid and Internet-Explorer-specificand so the IE team have to maintain
backwards compatibility with thatand that hurts the web. What can we do to reach this huge group ofpeople?
Everyone’s written a book about web technologies, and bookshelp, but books are dying. We want to get the
word out about all theamazing things that are now possible to everyone: do we know how? Dowe even have to
care? The theory is that this stuff will “trickledown”, but that doesn’t work for economics:
I’m not sure it works for`@-moz-keyframes` either.
