I’ve felt honored and somewhat amused to be a part of the Pastry Box Project. AsI look around at my
fellow bakers, I find that the majority are designers andusability gurus. I sit at the other end of the
spectrum when it comes to userinteractions — the work I do is on the server side, handling the
incomingrequests and providing responses; only the side effects of my work are seen bythe end user, and often
those are filtered through visual design I never touch.

And yet, I’d argue there’s another level of design that happens in this arena.The code written
must be readable and maintainable, both by myself in the futureas well as others. The interactions between
different code responsibilities mustbe clear and concise, and readily understood. The class names and methods
shouldcommunicate their purpose.

It’s tremendously easy and seductive to be able to write a few, quick lines ofcode that get the job
done. It’s a more interesting and rewarding job to makefunctional code self-documenting and
maintainable.

Code requires good design, too.
