You only live once. Remember that. Don’t let your days, hours, andminutes slip through like grains of
sand through the hourglass. Buildthe site, make that pet project that’s been bouncing around in
yourhead. Write the article. Write the book. Learn that skill. Share itwith others. Be intentional. Set goals.
Push yourself. If the thoughtof making or doing something fills you with fear, you must do it.Trepidation
signals an opportunity for growth and learning. And, ifyou don’t shoot, you don’t score, right?
