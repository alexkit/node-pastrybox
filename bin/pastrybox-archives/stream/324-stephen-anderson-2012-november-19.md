a particular direction — often the one taught to us. But, history shows us that both incremental and giant
leaps forward happen at the intersection of different — seemingly unrelated — ideas.

I’m finally coming to realize the upside to not having been formally trained in anything I do; I might
even say I’m proud of the fact that I’ve had no formal training or certifications. It’s the
discovery mindset that allows us to combine and create new things, things that in many cases go on to become
“how things are done.” But hear me on this: How things are done is we listen, observe, draw on our
experiences (and those around us) to identify and solve real problems. How things are done is not about the
resulting processes and tools that we see coming out of the very real process of inquiry. How things are done
starts with curiosity.

By coming at things sideways, without the safe rails of training, I’ve been forced to explore uncharted
spaces, creating along the way my own map of the landscape. I’ve never known to not combine things in a
certain way or that a particular tool is the “right” one for the job. I get to make stuff up as I
go along! And since I’m always learning, I guess I’m always making stuff up. In truth, we all are,
or all should be. 

At this point, rather than envy, I pity those who are trained in the “right way” to do things. It’s
difficult to see things from different perspectives when you’ve decided–consciously or
unconsciously–to follow a particular path through and around a problem space. For a field as nascent as
ours, there is no right way to do things. We’re all stumbling into the future.
