# a proliferation of “standards”.

Trying stuff out (perhaps with vendor prefixes) and reporting back is a vital part if standardisation. But
presenting whole new features as a fait accompli, and encouraging their use by developers on the open Web
loses discussion, the sharing of ideas and results from the process. The end-result loses ease for developers
and, ultimately, interoperability for consumers – you know, the great unwashed that we actually make
Websites for.

Tossing a specification that you’ve written in-house, in secret and already implemented onto a table at
W3C, saying “here, standardise this” as you saunter past isn’t a Get Out of Jail Free card
for proprietary misdemeanours. And it isn’t standardisation.
