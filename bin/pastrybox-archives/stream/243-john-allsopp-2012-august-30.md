# Artefacts

Photographs make for very big image files. Luckily, they can alsocompress significantly, with very little
noticeable decrease in imagequality (well, at least on lower resolution screens, weâ€™ll see whatimpact
higher resolution screens have on just how much we can compressimages in future).

But compress too far, and suddenly artefacts appear, the unavoidablefingerprint of a particular technology. We
see (and hear) thiselsewhere, with 3D rendering engines, audio formats, everywhere weemulate the organic
world, the analogue world with digital technology.

I sometimes wonder though whether these artefacts are bugs, or shouldwe treat them as features? Why do we see
the organic as the ideal, andthe synthetic, the digital as less pure, less real?

Increasingly, our lives are lived through digital experiences, film(often not simply a compression of the real
world, but a purelydigital emulation of it), and music (which often is digitally generatedand reproduced).

Years ago, Hip Hop DJs embraced the scratch, an artefact of mixingusing turntables and vinyl, and created an
entirely new sound.

I wonder ultimately what artefacts of the digital age will transcendtheir status as bugs, and become features
of digital media? If any?
