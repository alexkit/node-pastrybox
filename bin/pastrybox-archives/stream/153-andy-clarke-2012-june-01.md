There’s no reason why anyone should have to wait more than 24 hours for the money you owe them, especially
people you work with. So the next time you receive an invoice from a contractor or supplier, pay it right
away. Don’t wait a month, a week, a day or even an hour longer than you have to. Better still, find out how
to pay them before they start any work. That way you can pay them immediately when you receive their invoice.
They’ll feel good and so will you.
