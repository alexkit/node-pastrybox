This is where things get tricky. Generally we focus on improving our hard skills, and a great way to show this
is by documenting your progress on a weblog. It also lets you practice communicating ideas clearly. Try to
keep tabs on (and experiment with) what’s new in your field. You can keep up with the play by following
people’s blogs or on Twitter, and by going to events and meetups. 

Find people (and companies) you’d like to work with then follow their stuff, give useful feedback (for
example, pointing out a typo is always appreciated), and ask questions. By doing so you’ll get to know
like-minded people naturally, without needing to stray into the shady realms of “networking”. A lot of
finding a great job is luck, and forming these connections can be a great way to find out about work. 

If you really want to work at a specific company and think you have what it takes, meet someone who works
there (or send them a short, memorable note), and say so. They may not have something suitable for you right
then, so make a point to touch base occasionally to see how they’re going and if there’s anything you can
help with. If you’re already a fan it helps the employer because you’ll share values, and be more likely
to be a good fit. It can lead to an internship or a short-term project, which can easily lead to bigger
things. When approaching people be respectful of their time, and don’t feel offended if nothing happens
initially. It takes time to form a relationship — play the long game. 

Try to *think like an employer* — what can you bring to the table? Don’t feel overwhelmed by how little
you know when you’re just starting out, as employers are also looking for “potential”, and getting an
internship with a good company is a great opportunity. Also, make sure you’re genuine. Lying about your
skills or spamming people almost always backfires — even a hint of insincerity is a red flag. 

Finally and most importantly, always be learning and challenging yourself. Work to become the person an
employer wants to hire, someone with both hard and soft skills.
