At the beginning of, and indeed well into the 19th century, only a smallpercentage of even people in the
then-developed world were in anymodern sense literate.

And yet, the percentage of people in Western Europe and North Americaat that time who could read and write
probably exceeds the percentagein those places now who can program in any non-trivial sense.

The rise of literacy in the 19th Century was largely a sideeffect of the need for clerical skills in a rapidly
industrialisingworld, but gave rise to the modern world of medicine, science, and literature as a critical
mass of the population gained the capacityto improve themselves.

I believe, and hope the next great wave of literacy, with a similarlyunpredictable but extraordinary impact on
civilisation for the better,will be programmatic literacy, the near ubiquitous ability to
programcomputers.

This doesnâ€™t mean everyone in the world using JavaScript. In fact, partof the challenge is for us to
find ways to lower the barriers toprogramming that tend to hold people back from something which humansare
actually typically quite good at.

The web is an enormous step toward this possibility, but notuntil we start seeing these core skills in primary
schools, taughtalongside reading, writing, and mathematics, will we start seeing whatsort of revolution an
explosion of programming literacy might bring.
