This month, our team did the first non-beta release of our new site,[www.gov.uk](http://www.gov.uk/).

We’ve been very careful to refer to it as a release, rather than alaunch. Launching insinuates a thing
is done—that we’ve set ourboat off to sail and don’t intend to think about it again. A
launchsucceeds or fails, with not a lot in between. However, it’s not untilafter a launch that our real
users get to be onboard and find all thesnags and pitfalls. Those are the people we’ve been spending so
muchtime thinking about—it’s short-sighted of us to imagine that we’d beable to guess how
they’ll inevitably be using the site in anger.

User testing can only get so far and now we’re excited to learn howthe rest of the world reacts to our
release so we can improve in thenext one.
