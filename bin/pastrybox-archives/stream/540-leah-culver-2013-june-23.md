Woot.

Automatic updates seem like such a great idea… but then I worried about the consequences. What if an app
updates at a really inconvenient time?

Today I was waiting in the subway tunnel for my Muni train. No Wi-Fi. I was all ready to start reading a book
on my Kindle app when I noticed the Kindle app was stuck in the middle of an update. __Oh no! Code red!
Hypothetical situation has become reality!!__

I checked the status of the update in the App Store app and noticed there was an option to “pause” the
download. I clicked the button and my Kindle app returned to normal. __Phew.__

In addition to automatic updates, there are a couple other nice features of iOS 7 such as the Control Center
and the camera improvements. However, the thing that’s got most people talking is the new design.

I’m not a designer so I’m not going to get into the layout of the icons or the lack of shadows and bevels.
I just wanted to note that I think the design is a huge improvement for developers.

I downloaded Xcode 5 at the same time as iOS 7 so that I could start developing iOS 7 applications. I was
really impressed by how much better all the default styling and components look.

I’m super happy to see those ugly blue navigations bars and rounded rect buttons bite the dust. I’m ready
for change and I’m re-energized to build better looking iPhone apps with iOS 7.

It’s also just fun to ask, “so what’s your tintColor?”
