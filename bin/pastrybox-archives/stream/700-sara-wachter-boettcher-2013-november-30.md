I felt myself nodding along at this post from a fellow content strategist the other day, cheering for her dive
into the depths of the details, her rejection of hundred-page “recommendations documents,” her inclusion
in every prototype.

There’s something beautiful about bringing a content focus into the heart of a design team—about getting
content strategists “out of the sidelines and onto the fields” of a project. Tussling with language and
labels and tasks and concepts allows us to wrap our arms around a problem, wrestle with it, and solve it.
Designers and developers hear new perspectives. The whole project is strengthened, and it’s extremely
satisfying.

But I couldn’t help but feel like there’s another half to this story about what makes content strategy
powerful—a half we don’t talk nearly enough about in our urge to get agile and ship and productize all the
things.

It’s not in what we do on any given project, though. It’s in our opportunity to immerse people from far
outside our project teams into this always-changing world of web-making.

## Toward a parallel process

The thing is, we *do* need projects, those defined chunks of time and activity where *shit gets done.* We
can’t sit around eating deli sandwiches in conference rooms all day. We can’t try to solve every problem
and design for every platform with everyone in the room all at once. God, we’d all go nuts within a week.
Breaking things into stages or sprints or whatever works for your organization is necessary, and so is having
a defined team to work on those projects.

So lately I’ve been thinking a lot about how we can better juggle these two needs: the need to work on
content, closely and deeply, throughout the duration of a design project, *and* the need to empower all the
people who will make or break your project once it is out there in the wild to make good decisions and stay on
track.

I don’t have all the answers to this yet, but I do think the solution starts when we stop thinking of the
people who request and produce and update and approve content as outside of “our” web projects and teams,
and instead see them as just as critical to collaborate with as designers and developers.

This requires two parallel processes: one that’s all about keeping the project moving, and another that’s
all about shifting people and culture. Content strategists, at our best, are the bridge—the people who can
navigate both simultaneously, and reconnect them throughout the process.

For me, this has meant taking the questions I used to try to answer in documents, and asking my clients them
instead—often using hands-on activities that include people from as many departments and levels as possible:

 *  Where isn’t our content matching our mission? Why?

 *  What are its strengths?

 *  How could this be better organized?

 *  What content do our customers/readers need on their journeys?

 *  Do we have that content? What’s missing?

 *  Where and how should content be surfaced to support that?

 *  What’s keeping us from making content available at those times? How can we fix that? What structures
would enable that?

I used to think these questions were best left to the experts (a.k.a. me), but I don’t anymore. Because
I’m not the one who has to live with these decisions for the long term. The more I guide others as they
explore and debate and agree on answers, the more the strategy becomes not mine, but *theirs*.

It’s not always easy, of course, asking a workshop full of nonspecialists to agree on a core purpose or make
a content model or rewrite a page of copy in an hour. This isn’t their expertise, after all—it’s
mine.

But their version is often more powerful.

Because when strategy emerges from collaboration, it becomes shared knowledge. It becomes culture. It gives
our projects—those projects where we’ve worked so hard to roll up our sleeves and *make things*—a chance
to live on.
