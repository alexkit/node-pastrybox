I recently attended a graduate recruitment event to talk to studentsabout coming to work with us at
[KMP.](http://kmp.co.uk) A lot of them offeredto send me their CVs, some offered to send their pdf
portfolios.

I told each of them that I wouldn't read them. I'm more interested inpersonality and your work - online. Sure,
some background is importantbut generally I want to be sent URLs, Github accounts, your @ nameetc; you get the
picture.

Maybe I'm in the minority here, but it seems to me that schools,colleges and universities need to wise up and
move with the times bothin terms of course content, gaining employment and more. Creatingcloser links between
industry and education has to be the way to go.It's time to talk.
