My dad emailed me over the weekend, to ask if I’d seen [lingscars.com](http://lingscars.com/).He
wasn’t sure what to make of it—should he laugh or despair? I, ofcourse, had seen it before.  [Phil
Hawksworth](http://twitter.com/philhawksworth) uses it in his talks where he discusses over-using bells and
whistles, and being careful using pilesof JavaScript.

I emailed my dad back, and told him that yes, it’s done the rounds,and yes it’s still successful.
It struck me that it didn’t actuallymatter what I thought past that though—it’s awful in an
aestheticsense, but so what? It clearly gets them business. In the same week,I’d come across something I
hadn’t seen in a while—because I haveFlash disabled—a website with music! It was using
`<audio>`.Infuriating, because that’s exactly the sort of feature I dislikedabout the
“old” web and was blocking for, and it was back usingmodern, better, technologies—but what did I
really expect wouldhappen? That website creators across the internet wouldsimultaneously stop wanting jingles
on their website just because we’dswitched the technology on them?

We might be pushing out proprietary technologies like Flash, replacingthem with the open web-friendly options
like video, audio and WebGL,but we’re not changing expectations from users about how websitesshould
actually look and behave—what’s annoying, what teaches usersto be fooled, what puts them off,
what’s fun. The question for me isreally will this class of website, like Ling’s Cars, always
exist andwill we always just write them off without learning about why theystill work for a large set of our
audiences?
