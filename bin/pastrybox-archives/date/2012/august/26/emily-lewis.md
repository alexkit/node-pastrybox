 

I love project management. It is a huge part of my freelance business. In fact, it’s probably more
important than any other thing I do for my clients and projects (and sanity). 

At any given point, I usually have at least two client projects I’m working on. Combine that with my
“personal” projects and just running a business, there seem to be a million details I need to keep
track of every day. While I’m a naturally organized person (with a freakish passion for to-do lists),
strategic project management is the only way I’ve found to ensure that *everything* gets done on time
and to the best of my ability. 

I think that at least 50% of effective project management is tied to the person, and their internal ability to
organize, collaborate and communicate. Some folks just inherently make great project managers, and some
don’t. But that other half of project management, depends on tools. During my
almost–two–years of being self-employed, I’ve found some great ones that I simply could not
live without to manage the projects in my life.  

# Priority Inbox. This setting divides my inbox view into three sections: Important, Starred and
Everything Else. With just a few hours of use, Gmail starts "learning" which of my communications are
important to me, and those land in the Important section.

 

For me, Gmail is trained to treat all milestone notifications from Basecamp as priority, as well as event
reminders from my calendar. These are the emails that are time sensitive and, this way, I never miss them.
 

The Starred section, meanwhile, is used for emails of purchase receipts, such as from Amazon. So, when I do my
once–a–month expense management, I check the Starred section of my inbox for any business expenses
that should be entered into FreshBooks. And when I balance my personal checkbook each week, I also refer to
this section of my inbox for any personal expenses that need to be tracked.  

Then, when I’ve processed all of the email receipts in the Starred section, they each get a label
(Personal/Finance/Receipts) and archived in case I need to reference them in the future.  

After that, all that is left is Everything Else. I reference this portion of my inbox for personal
communications and emails that don’t need to be addressed immediately.
