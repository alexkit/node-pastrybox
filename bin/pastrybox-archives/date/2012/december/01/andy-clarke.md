‘Earth vs The Flying Saucers,’ ‘The Incredible Shrinking Man,’ ‘Them.’

All brilliant fifties and sixties sci-fi movies. Every one a classic. 

Why doesn’t Hollywood make giant, radioactive creature movies anymore? 

We’ve had giant ants, giant spiders. But there’s so much potential in the insect world for more
fantastic creature movies. 

Personally I’d like to see a movie about gigantic, radioactive snails. 

Just picture the scene, picture the suspense of giant shelled snails towering over New York, leaving a trail
of radioactive slime in their wake.

I can almost hear the dialogue.

“The snails are coming… run!”

“No, walk… slowly!”
