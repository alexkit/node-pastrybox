We had some family over to visit for the weekend recently. Over aglass or two of wine we were discussing kids,
the news, health, work,the usual stuff. The couple both happen to be police officers. Mywife’s cousin
told us about a particular incident she’d attended inwhich a teenage boy had hanged himself. It was her
and her fellowofficers duty to inform the boy’s parents of this terrible, tragicnews.

They arrived at the house to let the parents know what had happenedand offer support. When the door opened the
parents were clearlydistraught and in floods of tears. They already knew what had happenedto their darling
boy.

Later it transpired that the parents had found out the news not onlyof their son’s death but also the
circumstances via their neighbour,who had in-turn found out on Facebook.

Sometimes I think the Internet is the most wonderful of things. Othertimes I think it’s the most
terrible of things.
