It can take less than a decade for a prescient, profound, cleverobservation to become hackneyed (well worth
considering in itself), asit must be said has William Gibson’s observation in just 2003, that
“future is already here—it’s just not evenly distributed”.

I think we as early adopters, tinkerers, hackers, too often recitethis with a kind of smugness—yes, the
future has a arrived, and I’mliving it—you plebs just haven’t grokked it yet.

But just because the future is not evenly distributed, indeedprecisely because it is not __evenly__
distributed, it’snot just ours to have and to hold.

Take the “future of money”. We geeks with our squares and stripes andNFCs might think we are
living in the future of money. But these arejust incremental improvements, making it easy to use government
issuedcurrency, backed by banks and credit card companies and the entiretraditional economic edifice.
It’s not the future, it’s just a slightlymore convenient present.

But when we pull our head out of our developed backside, we’ll seesystems like
[M-Pesa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-Pesa), a truly transformative payment system withprofound, often
unforseen consequences from sub-Saharan Africa to thesubcontinent. 

M-Pesa reminded me of the story of Keralan fisherman, and the profoundand positive transformation in their
lives wrought by the introductionof the mobile phone, first brought to my attention by the fantastic
MarkPesce some years ago, and covered at the Economist.

While we too often use the extraordinary capabilities of thetechnologies that are emerging around us all the
time for trivialpurposes, elsewhere, these are transforming lives, countries, wholeregions.

So maybe instead of focussing on what is happening in the Valley, orthe Bay Area, we should be focussing on
what is happening in Kenya,Cambodia, and the other places where the future has also unevenlyarrived?
