We talk a lot about work-life balance, but I wonder how many of ustruly achieve it? I’ve been doing a
lot of soul-searching lately,desperate to figure out how I have over-extended myself work-wise tothe point
that I’m constantly disappointing editors by being late, notgetting tasks done on time, and basically
just losing my once-powerfulgrip over the thing I always did well: Work. 

Is it aging that has made me this way? Discouragement with the dramasof our industry—the technology wars,
the fragmentation of aonce-clear vision of what The Web was meant to and could become—could these things be
in my way? Or is it that I just haven’t stoppedto give myself a chance to have a life and life is
calling to me now—but I have yet to reconcile the relationship and remain stuck, ormoving toward that
desired balance at a snail's pace? 

Here’s some advice from the heart: There is nothing wrong with givingyour life to an ideal. I have done
it, and the rewards are rich—friends from all over the world, respect from my peers, to havetraveled much of
the earth and been made welcome upon it—that is themiraculous part of giving your work your all, it comes
back. Justdon’t let what happened to me happen to you—the work, the idealtakes over too young and for
too long, and you could easily end upchildless or without family, with little or no life structure or
realmeasure of how to reconcile this elusive balance.

I know eventually I will reconcile what work/life balance really meansfor me. This pastry has been baked with
love for you—work hard, dobeautiful and important work, and make a rich life for yourself in allways—for
that will sustain you through your entire life.
