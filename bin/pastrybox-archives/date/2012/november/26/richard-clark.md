I was reading a book recently and came across a passage in which a manwas returning to the place where he grew
up as a child. The authorsummed up the character’s feelings perfectly
—

> “he felt like a ghost haunting his own
> past”

It instantly struck a chord with me because it’s exactly how I feelwhen I look back at code I wrote last
year, 6 months ago or even lastweek. We’re always learning, always improving and being our own
worstcritiques. In my opinion that’s the way it should be.
