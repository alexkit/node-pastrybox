Ever work on an open source project? If so, and for long enough, youâ€™ve likelyencountered users who feel
entitled and become abusive when the code does notwork the way they expect, or contributors who belittle the
contributions ofothers.

If these same people worked face to face, would they act the same way? And ifthey did, would we tolerate
it?

We would not. Disagreements can happen and still be conducted in a civilfashion. We should not tolerate
abusive behavior online.
