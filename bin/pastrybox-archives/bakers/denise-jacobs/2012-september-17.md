# Hell Yeah”. I’m moving to embodying the trust and honesty necessary to choose only that which truly
has heart.

If your previous life decisions have been governed by shoulds like so many of mine have, and you are
consequently harboring a latent dissatisfaction with your life in certain areas, then join me in starting to
question every single last “should” on your list. My idea for my new Life Decision Workflow is to replace
all “should”s with “I can’t wait to…!” to test the strength of the idea. If this new version of
the phrase rings true, then you know that not only does it have heart, but that you have a hell yeah situation
on your hands. If not, then cross it off the list. I know it sounds trite, but life really is too short to
waste.
