You’ve probably heard about the importance of empathy in design and communication work—of understanding
others’ emotions and considering their feelings when we make things for them to use. Corey Vilhauer has
called it “[content strategy’s hidden
deliverable](http://www.slideshare.net/blendinteractive/empathy-content-strategys-hidden-deliverable-cs-forum-2012).”
Kate Kiefer Lee says it’s [central to MailChimp’s
content](http://uxmag.com/articles/tone-and-voice-showing-your-users-that-you-care). Whitney Hess believes
it’s the foundation of an “[environment that encourages collaboration, iteration, and
risk](http://whitneyhess.com/blog/2012/04/21/user-experience-is-not-enough/).”

But empathy isn’t easy. As much as I want to have it, as much as I believe in it, I fall down on the job a
lot. I dole out advice better than I listen. I get frustrated with people who just can’t figure things out.
I’m quick to be an editor when I ought to simply be a friend. 

I think I might have found the real problem, though. We can’t begin being empathetic when another person
arrives. We have to already have made a space in our lives where empathy can thrive. And that means being
open—truly open—to feeling emotions we may not want to feel. It means allowing another’s experiences to
gut us. It means ceding control.

Empathy begins with vulnerability. And being vulnerable, especially in our work, is fucking terrifying.

## Professionally vulnerable

There’s a safety in creating distance—in carefully managing perceptions and avoiding the things that make
you feel unprepared and unworthy. It’s easier to get by when you have a buffer.

But that distance not only keeps you from greatness; it also numbs you. It protects you from your own
emotions, sure. But it also makes it impossible to feel anyone else’s. 

I can’t afford to be numb. I have users to help. I have problems to solve. I have got to get more
comfortable with being uncomfortable. 

Empathy starts with vulnerability. And I’m still working on it.
