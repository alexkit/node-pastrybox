Summer is long over and fall arrives with a flurry of new activity:you recommit to old projects as new
projects surface. There’s yardwork, taking the boys to hockey, organizing family events,
cooking,cleaning, and readying for winter. I find the days of my life seem tofly by like fence pickets as you
drive down the highway. Once a month,I sit down and take stock. Are my life goals still the same? How
muchcloser am I to achieving them? Do I need to push myself more? What doI need to adjust? How’s the
balance? I find that this short, butnecessary reflection is the difference between mere existence and
anexamined life.
