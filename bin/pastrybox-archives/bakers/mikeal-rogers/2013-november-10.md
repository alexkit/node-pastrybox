# Grunt use Node to automate the mundane tasks that plague every web developer. These are accessible to
every __web__ developer. Web developers move seamlessly through operating system and browser. Each component
uses common language and a few standard patterns. Code now blurs the lines between realms and so people do the
same.

There is no longer a Node community. Node has become a vertebra in the spine of the Web. People will surely
identify with a camp be it Grunt, Node, or Lo-Dash. But we should not confuse identity with community.

I often publish a little module. It may be for a single website to be run in Node.js. I resign those
restrictions in the act of publication. The accessibility of npm, the capabilities it gains when connected
with other modules, give it more meaning than I did alone. Any developer can use this module in any
environment. They consume it with even less effort than it took for me to publish it.

Compatibility increases accessibility. As people join the ecosystem their consumption is a form of
collaboration. Collaboration in the absence of coordination. The ensuing growth is more than we can identify
as "frontend", "backend", "Node", or "Grunt." We are left with only the identity of "The Web."
