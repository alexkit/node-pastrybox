It succinctly captures what I am involved with and see happening inthe web standards world. Now for the second
time in fact. First we hadthe decision in 2004 at a W3C Workshop around Web Applications (nowreferred to as
“The Workshop”) to no longer work on HTML andJavaScript, but instead focus on XML. To counter that
decision theWHATWG was formed and proved the W3C wrong. The W3C now heralds HTML5as one of its success
stories.

Now the WHATWG is our new story and it has ably demonstrated thatthe bureaucracy of the standards process can
be circumvented. Morebecame possible, if you will. The second time came when the W3Creaffirmed its stance on a
restrictive license for specifications.Specifications belong to anyone. They prove themselves by being inwide
use. That combined with the fact that the W3C Process requireseditors to do a lot of make work, of which
complaints during my sevenyears there went unaddressed, made me feel my time would be betterspent
elsewhere.
