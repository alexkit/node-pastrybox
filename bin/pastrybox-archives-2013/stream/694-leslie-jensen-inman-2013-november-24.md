# Enabling leadership

We can perform acts of leadership as the design lead, project lead, or manager and those people who serve in
roles that appear under our roles in an organization chart can *also* perform acts of leadership. 

We become enablers of leadership instead of the only people who have the authority, responsibility, and
ability to lead. This also allows the people we work with to be more invested in the work we’re doing
*together* and the relationships we’re building *together* because they know they play an important role in
the working relationship. 

This understanding empowers people to take initiative and perform great acts of leadership. People start to
share their ideas and skills with the group. They begin to lead meetings, discussions, and critiques. They
begin to encourage other group members to take a more active role. All of this combined, provides us more
flexibility with our teams because we can trust that teammates will step up and lead. We no longer need to
lead everything, therefore we can focus our attention on specific tasks that need to get finished.

By encouraging students, employees, and colleagues to perform acts of leadership we help our industry grow and
mature. And when we help others practice their leadership skills, we are in turn sharpening our own leadership
skills. When we let go of the idea that only leaders can lead, we open ourselves to a world where leadership
is nurtured, developed, and shared.
