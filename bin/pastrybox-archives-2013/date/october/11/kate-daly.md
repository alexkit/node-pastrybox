# We like people, and we want to talk to them.

English majors are the ones who invent the party games where you watch a movie and take a drink whenever a
character or situation indicates foreshadowing. We’re also the people who know what it’s like to move our
desks in a circle and read something to the class that you couldn’t get through writing without crying. We
want to talk. We want to share. We want to talk about sharing. We’re good at talking to clients because we
want to listen and craft their stories into something meaningful. It’s like finding a box of photos and
arranging them in an album as a gift, only to have the recipient say with heartfelt thanks, “Wow. I can
*use* this now.” If you want true understanding of a user’s needs, hire an English major to have the
conversation and retell the story of what they learned; this time, more beautifully.

My senior year of college, I didn’t know what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. I thought I might
open a rubber-stamp store and spend my days by a creekside writing. I figured something would work out, and it
did. Next time you’ve got an open position in your IS department, take a walk down to the water. You may
find an English major there, wondering what’s going to happen next.
