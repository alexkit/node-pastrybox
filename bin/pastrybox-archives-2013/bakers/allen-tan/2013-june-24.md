# Ira Glass quote is well-known: but it cuts both ways. Just as your skill may not yet meet your high
standards, you may also be quite skilled but not have developed taste — not having a strong enough sense of
what’s great and what can be dropped. If one far exceeds the other, it’s time to work on bolstering
what’s fallen short.



 *  __Guiding them towards doing the above by themselves.__ This is the hardest one. But they’re not always
going to have someone else they trust and knows them better than themselves. It’ll require being honest and
vulnerable, and will feel like digging around in an open wound. It’s not pleasant, but it’s
necessary.
