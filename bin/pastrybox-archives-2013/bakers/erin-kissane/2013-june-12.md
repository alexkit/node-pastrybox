It’s college graduation season, so there’s been a lot of advice circulating for young designers/coders
etc. on how to get a first job and how to succeed at it. A lot of this advice is really good. I want to add a
few things from a perspective that doesn’t get much direct attention: what it means to come to a
professional world from outside, and how that outsiderness can be both difficult and helpful.

“Outside” can mean a lot of things, and many, *many* of us who work on the web grew up poor or very far
away or without a formal design education or one of a million different outsides. The early web attracted
weirdos and misfits like you wouldn’t believe, and many now run successful companies. This is a malleable
field, and if you’re interested enough, there’s probably a place for you—but it won’t necessarily be
easy to find it. But you don’t have to do it alone. 

## The dangers of being valuable

There are a lot of open jobs in tech right now that pay a lot of money and offer a lot of perks for people
with the right skills. If your background hasn’t prepared you to assume that you’re destined for a high
salary job with a prestigious company, this may feel especially surreal. This is good! One of the hidden
strengths of being from *not-around-here* is that some things that seem normal to most people in the field may
seem weird to you. And sometimes, sensitivity to weirdness can save you. 

You may, for instance, already realize that if you’ve been hired into a prestigious, high-paying job as a
junior designer/programmer/whatever, this probably has as much to do with a fluctuating market as with your
own skills. If the people you grew up around don’t have access to that kind of job, you probably already
know that you can be extremely skilled and work very hard and still barely make a living. 

So why is that awareness useful? Leaving aside minor things like empathy and wariness toward entitlement,
you’ll be better prepared for inevitable changes in the market value of your own skills. More importantly,
you’ll be significantly less vulnerable to one particular flavor of manipulation: When you internalize the
idea that you’re precious and irreplaceable in a company or an industry, it’s easy to be wooed into
life-altering decisions like handing over years of 80-hour weeks to companies whose work you don’t actually
care about. The more you accept this flattery as your due, the easier it is to be hypnotized by interests that
conflict with your own. 

Keeping the rest of the world—including the part you came from—in your peripheral vision can keep you from
getting bewitched.
